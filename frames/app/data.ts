- Shade Stalkers: These ghostly entities are immune to physical damage but can be banished or weakened by holy artifacts, sacred ground, or spells that cleanse or protect against evil. Light-based magic or objects can also disrupt their form and force them into retreat.

- Bloodwood Trees: To defeat a Bloodwood Tree, one must destroy its heartwood, a vital organ usually hidden beneath layers of bark and protected by magical defenses. Fire is effective, but the true key lies in disrupting the dark magic that gives it life, perhaps through a ritual or a blessed weapon.
    
- Grimwarden Spiders: Overcoming these creatures requires disrupting their illusory webs and facing them in the physical realm, where they are less formidable. Spells that dispel magic or reveal truth can strip away their deceptions, making them vulnerable to conventional attacks.

    return `
- Necroserpents: These undead serpents are immune to poison and disease but can be destroyed by decapitation or holy magic. They are also repelled by objects or substances that are anathema to the undead, such as garlic, holy water, or silver.

- Wraithknights: To banish a Wraithknight, one must often break the curse that binds them. This could involve avenging a wrong, completing a task left unfinished, or destroying an object of significant personal value to the knight from its living days.
    
- Mournmothers: Defeating a Mournmother usually requires countering her dark magic with light or life-affirming energies. This could be achieved through blessings, purification rituals, or destroying objects of power that she draws her strength from.

  } else {
    return `
- Bone Golems: Bone Golems are held together by necromantic energy. Disrupting this energy, either by destroying the source (such as a controlling amulet or a necromancer) or using powerful magic that disrupts undead, can cause them to crumble.

- Fleshscourge Demons: These demons are resistant to physical damage but can be banished back to their dimension or weakened significantly by spells and weapons imbued with sacred or pure energies. Binding or sealing rituals may be required to prevent their return.
    
- Dread Reapers: Invisible and intangible, they can only be harmed when they are about to strike. Revealing spells, mirrors, or items that reveal the truth can expose them, and they can only be harmed by weapons or magic that affects ethereal beings.
